# Algorath

This is the solution to the test exercise I was asked for. 

In this repository you will find the server for the project Algorath. It contain the entities for the dummy database you can find in the 
[Algorath repository](https://github.com/rubenwest/Algorath.git).

# Getting started

To get started you should clone this respository on your local directory
* `$git clone https://github.com/rubenwest/Algorath.git`

Then in your project directory get to client route and get npm install (remember using sudo if you are a linux user)
* `cd /client`
* `$ npm install`

Next get to install and wakeup the Node server and MongoDB:

* `cd /server`
* `$ npm install`
* `$ npm start`

And the finally you get wake up the client:

* `cd /client`
* `$ npm start`

Voila!

You can now use the application!
